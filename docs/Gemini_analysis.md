Okay, let's analyze this codebase for potential optimizations, enhancements, and best practices. This is a great project, faithfully recreating a classic design while leveraging FPGA capabilities.

**Overall Assessment:**

* **Well-Structured:** The project follows a clear directory structure (`src`, `test`, `constraints`, `scripts`, `docs`).
* **Well-Documented:** The `README.md` is excellent, providing clear goals, status, and context. The `field_notes.md` is particularly valuable, showing a good understanding of FPGA concepts and debugging challenges.
* **Good Use of Verilog/SystemVerilog:** Leverages features like `enums`, `structs`, `always_ff`, `always_comb` effectively.
* **Modular Design:** Breaking the computer down into components (ALU, RAM, registers, etc.) is good practice.
* **Automated Workflow:** The `build.sh` and `simulate.sh` scripts provide a solid foundation for development.
* **Clear Goals:** The aim to replicate Ben Eater's design first, then extend, is a sensible approach.

Here's a breakdown by category with suggestions:

---

**1. Design & Architecture Enhancements:**

* **Reset Strategy Consistency:**
  * `field_notes.md` details struggles with synchronous vs. asynchronous resets. The codebase seems to have settled on mostly synchronous resets within `always_ff` blocks (`if (reset)`), which is generally preferred for synthesis and timing analysis *but* requires the reset signal to be synchronous to the clock or held long enough.
  * However, `clock_divider.v` uses an asynchronous reset (`always @(posedge clk_in or posedge reset)`).
  * `register_nbit.sv` uses `always @(posedge clk)` with an `if (reset)` check inside â€“ this implies a synchronous reset but uses incorrect Verilog constructs (see Implementation section).
  * **Recommendation:** Choose *one* reset strategy (synchronous or asynchronous active-high/low) and apply it consistently across *all* modules. Document this choice. Asynchronous reset (`always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset)`) is often easier for simulation startup and initial bring-up, as noted in your field notes. Synchronous reset (`always_ff @(posedge clk) begin if (reset) ...`) requires careful handling of the reset signal itself (synchronization, minimum pulse width). Given the notes, standardizing on asynchronous reset might be simpler.
* **RAM Implementation (Resource Usage):**
  * `ram.sv` uses `reg [7:0] ram [0:15];`. This synthesizes to distributed logic (LUTs and FFs). For 16 bytes, this is acceptable on most FPGAs.
  * **Enhancement:** If you plan to significantly increase RAM size (as mentioned for SAP-2 extensions), this approach will become very resource-intensive. You should structure the RAM module to infer Block RAM (BRAM), which is dedicated memory hardware on the FPGA. This typically involves a single clocked process for writes and potentially a separate process or combinatorial logic for reads (depending on whether you need registered or unregistered outputs). Check your FPGA vendor's documentation (Lattice for iCE40) or Yosys documentation for BRAM inference templates.
  * **Enhancement:** The current RAM reads continuously (`data_out <= ram[address];`). While reads are non-destructive, explicitly controlling reads with an enable signal (often derived from `oe_ram` but potentially separate) can sometimes help with timing or power, though maybe not strictly necessary here.
* **ALU Flag Logic:**
  * In `alu.sv`, `result_out`, `carry_flag`, `zero_flag`, and `negative_flag` are all registered (`always_ff`).
  * `zero_flag` and `negative_flag` are calculated based on the *registered* `result_out`. This means they reflect the result from the *previous* clock cycle's operation, not the one currently being calculated within the `case` statement.
  * **Recommendation:** Decide if flags should reflect the *current* combinatorial result of the ALU operation or the *registered* result.
    * *Combinatorial Flags:* Calculate flags based on the *inputs* (`a_in`, `b_in`) or the *intermediate* result within the `always_ff` block *before* it gets registered (requires temporary variables).
    * *Registered Flags (Current approach):* This is valid but introduces a 1-cycle delay in the flags relative to the operation that generated them. Ensure the control logic accounts for this if necessary (e.g., conditional jumps might need to wait an extra cycle or sample flags differently).
* **Conditional Jumps (JZ, JC):**
  * The microcode for `JZ`/`JC` includes `check_zero: 1` / `check_carry: 1`.
  * The logic to *use* these flags to conditionally execute the `load_pc` seems commented out or missing in the `S_EXECUTE` state's `always_comb` block in `computer.sv`.
  * **Enhancement:** Implement the conditional logic. This typically involves checking the flag *and* the corresponding `check_` signal from the control word. If the condition is *not* met, the `load_pc` should be suppressed, and the FSM should transition back to `S_FETCH_0` instead of loading the jump address. Consider the ALU flag timing mentioned above.
* **Bus Implementation:**
  * The `assign bus = (oe_...) ? ... : ... : 8'b0;` correctly models the shared bus using a multiplexer, which is the standard FPGA approach. Using `8'b0` as the default is safer than `8'bz` for synthesis, although `8'bz` is fine for simulation clarity.

---

**2. Verilog/SystemVerilog Implementation Issues & Optimizations:**

* **`register_nbit.sv` - Critical Issues:**
  * Uses `always @(posedge clk)` instead of the more explicit SystemVerilog `always_ff @(posedge clk)`. While functionally similar, `always_ff` clearly signals intent for synthesizing flip-flops.
  * Uses a blocking assignment (`latched_data <= 4'b0;`) for the *reset* condition within the sequential block. **Never use blocking assignments (`=`) for signals assigned within `always_ff` or `always @(posedge clk)` blocks.** Use non-blocking assignments (`<=`) exclusively for sequential logic outputs.
  * The reset value is hardcoded to `4'b0`, completely ignoring the `N` parameter. It should be `{N{1'b0}}`.
  * **Recommendation:** Rewrite this module correctly:

        ```systemverilog
        module register_nbit #(
            parameter N = 8
        ) (
            input             clk,
            input             reset, // Assuming active-high asynchronous reset based on other modules/notes
            input             load,
            input    [N-1:0]  data_in,
            output  logic [N-1:0] latched_data // Use logic instead of reg
        );

            // Use asynchronous reset consistent with clock_divider, field notes preference for sim
            always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
                if (reset) begin
                    latched_data <= {N{1'b0}}; // Use non-blocking, use N
                end else if (load) begin
                    latched_data <= data_in;   // Use non-blocking
                end
                // Optional: else latched_data <= latched_data; (holds value - implied)
            end

        endmodule
        ```

* **`ram.sv` Initialization:**
  * The ``ifndef SIMULATION` block with the `initial` statement works for synthesis but isn't standard for simulation initialization.
  * **Recommendation:** For simulation, use `$readmemh` in the testbench to load `program.hex` into the RAM instance (`uut.u_ram.ram`). This keeps the test stimulus separate from the design code. For synthesis, if you need initialized RAM, check Yosys/Lattice docs for the preferred method (often inferring ROM or using specific initial block syntax for BRAM). The current `initial` block *might* work for LUTRAM but isn't ideal for BRAM.

        ```systemverilog
        // In testbench initial block:
        initial begin
          // ... setup ...
          $readmemh("path/to/program.hex", uut.u_ram.ram); // Load hex file into simulated RAM
          // ... rest of test ...
        end
        ```

* **`computer.sv` Microcode ROM:**
  * The `initial` block to populate `microcode_rom` is acceptable and synthesizable (Yosys will likely create a logic ROM).
  * **Alternative:** For larger microcode stores, consider using `$readmemh` to load the microcode from an external file during elaboration (both simulation and synthesis). This makes modifying the microcode easier.
* **`seg7_display.v` Digit Extraction:**
  * The combinational logic uses division (`/`) and multiplication (`*`) implicitly via subtraction to extract digits. Synthesizers *can* handle this for constant divisors (like 100 and 10), but it can sometimes lead to inefficient or slow logic compared to dedicated BCD conversion algorithms (like Double Dabble) if resources/timing become tight. For 8 bits -> 3 digits, it's likely okay, but be aware if you expand.
* **Parameterization:**
  * Good use of parameters in `program_counter`, `register_nbit`, `clock_divider`.
  * **Enhancement:** Consider parameterizing the `ADDR_WIDTH` and `DATA_WIDTH` more globally (e.g., in `microarch_defs.sv` or a package) and using those parameters throughout the design (PC, MAR, RAM, bus width, etc.) for easier modification later.

---

**3. Simulation & Verification:**

* **Testbench Structure:** Good approach with `test_utils_pkg` and opcode-specific tests.
* **Stimulus Timing:** Using `@(negedge clk)` or delays (`#1`) after the active edge to change inputs is robust practice.
* **Assertions:**
  * `pretty_print_assert_vec` is helpful for visual feedback.
  * **Enhancement:** Consider adding SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) directly in the testbenches or even within the design modules (bound separately or within `ifdef SIMULATION`) for more rigorous checking of properties (e.g., `assert property (@(posedge clk) load_a |=> ##1 bus === a_out);`).
* **Coverage:** Are all microcode paths and state transitions being tested? Consider adding functional coverage collection if the design grows significantly more complex.
* **RAM Initialization in Sim:** As mentioned before, use `$readmemh` in the testbench. The current method of directly assigning `uut.u_ram.ram[...]` works but couples the test tightly to the DUT internal structure.

---

**4. Build & Workflow:**

* **Scripts:** `build.sh` and `simulate.sh` are well-written and handle common tasks, including `sv2v`.
* **File Lists (`_files_*.f`):**
  * `src/_files_synth.f` incorrectly includes `test/test_utilities_pkg.sv`. Test utilities should not be synthesized.
  * **Recommendation:** Remove `test/test_utilities_pkg.sv` from `_files_synth.f`. Ensure only synthesizable source files are listed there.
* **Error Handling:** The scripts use `set -e` and `set -o pipefail`, which is good. Logging functions are helpful.
* **sv2v:** Using `sv2v` is a practical way to handle SystemVerilog features with tools that might have limited native support. Converting all SV files at once (`sv2v "${SV_FILES[@]}" > "$combined_sv2v_file"`) is the correct approach to handle inter-file dependencies like packages.

---

**5. Constraints:**

* **Timing Constraints (`.sdc`):** Defining the input clock (`clk`) and the PLL output clock (`clk_out`) is essential. Good start.
* **Enhancement:** For more rigorous timing, you might eventually need:
  * `set_input_delay` / `set_output_delay` constraints if interfacing with external components with specific timing requirements (not applicable here as it seems self-contained).
  * False path constraints (`set_false_path`) for paths that are structurally present but logically impossible (e.g., between asynchronous clock domains if any existed).
* **Pin Constraints (`.pcf`):** Seems correct for the specified hardware. Good use of comments to show unused pins.

---

**Summary of Key Recommendations:**

1. **Fix `register_nbit.sv`:** Correct the use of blocking assignments, reset logic, and parameter usage.
2. **Standardize Reset Strategy:** Choose sync or async reset and apply consistently. Update `register_nbit`, `program_counter`, `alu`, etc., accordingly. Async seems favoured by your notes/experience.
3. **Review ALU Flag Timing:** Ensure the 1-cycle delay on `zero_flag` and `negative_flag` is intended and handled correctly by control logic (especially for planned conditional jumps).
4. **Plan for BRAM:** If RAM size will increase for SAP-2, modify `ram.sv` to infer BRAM.
5. **Implement Conditional Jumps:** Complete the logic in `computer.sv`'s FSM to handle `check_zero`/`check_carry`.
6. **Refine Simulation Init:** Use `$readmemh` in testbenches to load RAM/microcode from files.
7. **Clean `_files_synth.f`:** Remove non-synthesis files like test utilities.
8. **Parameterize Widths:** Consider global parameters for data/address widths.

This is a solid foundation. Addressing these points, particularly the `register_nbit` fix and reset consistency, will improve robustness and prepare the design for the planned extensions. Keep up the great work and documentation!
