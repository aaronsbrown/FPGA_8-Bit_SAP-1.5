# Ben Eater 8-bit Computer (FPGA Implementation)

This project is a Verilog-based recreation of Ben Eater's classic breadboard 8-bit computer, implemented on an FPGA. The goal is to reproduce the original architecture faithfully — including the control logic, shared bus, and instruction cycle — and run programs with the same step-based execution model. Once the base version is working, the plan is to explore extensions that would be much harder to prototype with discrete TTL chips.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Faithfully replicate Ben Eater's 8-bit CPU on an FPGA.
- Use Verilog/SystemVerilog to build each module (registers, ALU, RAM, control unit, etc.).
- Utilize SystemVerilog packages for centralized type and parameter definitions (`arch_defs_pkg`).
- Parameterize core architecture (DATA_WIDTH, ADDR_WIDTH) for future expansion.
- Mirror the shared bus architecture using multiplexers controlled by output enables.
- Simulate using Icarus Verilog + GTKWave.
- Load and execute simple machine code programs.
- Implement a microcoded control unit for extensible instruction handling.
- Standardize on synchronous design practices (clocking, reset, non-blocking assignments).
- Later: explore extensions like stack support, more RAM, additional instructions.
- Write a small Python-based assembler to support mnemonic instructions and simplify program authoring.

## 🧰 Hardware

- FPGA Board: Alchitry Cu (Lattice iCE40 HX)
- Expansion Board: Alchitry Io (optional for buttons, LEDs)
- No external RAM, just internal FPGA BRAM/logic blocks (using parameterized RAM module).

## 🚦 Project Status

- [x] Project initialized & basic structure defined.
- [x] Core parameters (`DATA_WIDTH`, `ADDR_WIDTH`) and types (`opcode_t`, `control_word_t`, etc.) centralized in `arch_defs_pkg`.
- [x] Modules parameterized (`computer`, `alu`, `ram`, `register_nbit`, `program_counter`, `register_instruction`).
- [x] Bus + register structure implemented.
- [x] Consistent synchronous reset strategy implemented.
- [x] Correct use of non-blocking assignments (`<=`) in sequential blocks.
- [x] ALU logic implemented for ADD, SUB, AND, OR; outputs combinational flags (Z, N, C) and registered result. Correct C flag (Not Borrow) semantics for SUB.
- [x] **Flags Register (`u_register_flags`) implemented** in `computer.sv` to hold Z, C, N state.
- [x] **`load_flags` control bit added** and set in microcode for ADD/SUB.
- [x] Instruction cycle FSM implemented with combinational control signal generation.
- [x] Program loading via `$readmemh` in simulation implemented and used in testbenches.
- [x] RAM module structured for synchronous operation (registered output) and BRAM inference.
- [x] Most core modules individually verified via simulation.
- [x] FPGA synthesis + LED output tested (basic functionality).
- [x] Microcoded instruction execution verified for: LDA, LDB, LDI, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, STA, JMP, OUTA, HLT.
- [x] FSM timing bug fixed with opcode stabilization step (`S_WAIT`).
- [x] Testbench simulation timing corrected to observe results accurately after completion edges.
- [ ] **Finalize `load_flags` microcode:** Decide and implement which other instructions (AND, OR, LDI/LDA/LDB?, future INC/DEC?) should modify flags and set `load_flags=1` accordingly.
- [ ] **Implement Conditional Jump FSM Logic:** Modify `S_EXECUTE` logic to read registered flags (`flags_out`) and suppress `load_pc` based on `check_zero`/`check_carry`.
- [ ] **Test Conditional Jumps:** Create and pass `op_JZ_tb.sv` and `op_JC_tb.sv`.
- [ ] **Implement & Test `XOR`:** Add opcode, ALU case, microcode, and testbench.
- [ ] **Implement & Test `CMP`:** Add opcode, microcode (uses `ALU_SUB`, sets `load_flags=1`, no result store), and testbench.
- [ ] Add extended instruction set (e.g., `INC`, `DEC`, Shifts/Rotates).
- [ ] Add stack support (`SP` register, `PUSH`, `POP`) and `CALL`/`RET` instructions.
- [ ] Implement RAM initialization for synthesis robustly (e.g., using `$readmemh` in `ram.sv` initial block).

## 🔧 Simulation

To run a specific simulation testbench (e.g., the Jump test):

```bash
./scripts/simulate.sh --tb op_JMP_tb.sv
```
(Tests typically load their specific program into RAM using `$readmemh` from the `fixture/` directory).

🧪 **Test Strategy**

Each module is individually verified via simulation using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave before integrating into the full CPU. System-level tests verify instruction execution by running small programs loaded from `.hex` files and asserting expected register and flag states at precise clock cycles corresponding to instruction completion.

🛠️ **Tools**
 * Icarus Verilog (Simulator)
 * GTKWave (Waveform Viewer)
 * sv2v (SystemVerilog to Verilog converter, used by scripts)
 * Yosys (Synthesis)
 * nextpnr (Place and Route for iCE40)
 * icepack/iceprog (Bitstream packing/uploading)

## 🛣️ Next Milestone: Conditional Logic & SAP-2 Features

With the core instruction cycle stable, parameterized, and control logic corrected, the next critical steps involve **state management for flags**:
1. Implement the **Flags Register** hardware in `computer.sv`. <!-- Already Done -->
2. Implement the **`load_flags` control mechanism** via the microcode to selectively update the Flags Register only for instructions that should affect flags (ALU ops, CMP, potentially loads/INC/DEC). <!-- Partially Done -->
3. Implement the **conditional execution logic** in the FSM to read the *registered* flags and modify behavior (specifically suppressing `load_pc` for jumps) based on `check_zero`/`check_carry` bits.

Once these are complete and `JZ`/`JC` are tested:
- Implement and test a `CMP` instruction.
- Implement and test `XOR`.

Subsequent goals move toward a SAP-2-style architecture as described in Malvino's *Digital Computer Electronics*:
- Stack support via a dedicated stack pointer register (`SP`).
- `PUSH`, `POP`, `CALL`, and `RET` instructions.
- Other instructions like `INC`, `DEC`, Shifts, Rotates.
- Robust synthesis-time RAM initialization.

These additions will allow the CPU to support more complex programs, subroutines, and branching logic.
