# Ben Eater 8-bit Computer (FPGA Implementation)

This project is a Verilog-based recreation of Ben Eater's classic breadboard 8-bit computer, implemented on an FPGA. The goal is to reproduce the original architecture faithfully ‚Äî including the control logic, shared bus, and instruction cycle ‚Äî and run programs with the same step-based execution model. Once the base version is working, the plan is to explore extensions that would be much harder to prototype with discrete TTL chips.

## üß† Project Goals

- Faithfully replicate Ben Eater's 8-bit CPU on an FPGA.
- Use Verilog/SystemVerilog to build each module (registers, ALU, RAM, control unit, etc.).
- Mirror the shared 8-bit bus architecture using multiplexers controlled by output enables.
- Simulate using Icarus Verilog + GTKWave.
- Load and execute simple machine code programs.
- Implement a microcoded control unit for extensible instruction handling.
- Standardize on synchronous design practices (clocking, reset).
- Later: explore extensions like stack support, more RAM, additional instructions, parameterization.
- Write a small Python-based assembler to support mnemonic instructions and simplify program authoring.

- Expansion Board: Alchitry Io (optional for buttons, LEDs)
- No external RAM, just internal FPGA BRAM/logic blocks.

## üîß Simulation

To run a specific simulation testbench (e.g., the LDI test):

```bash
./scripts/simulate.sh --tb op_LDI_tb.sv
```
(Tests typically load their specific program into RAM using `$readmemh` from the `fixture/` directory).


üß™ **Test Strategy**

Each module is individually verified via simulation using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave before integrating into the full CPU. System-level tests verify instruction execution by running small programs loaded from `.hex` files and asserting expected register states.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**
 * Icarus Verilog (Simulator)
 * GTKWave (Waveform Viewer)
 * sv2v (SystemVerilog to Verilog converter, used by scripts)
 * Yosys (Synthesis)
 * nextpnr (Place and Route for iCE40)
 * icepack/iceprog (Bitstream packing/uploading)

## üõ£Ô∏è Next Milestone: Conditional Logic & SAP-2 Features

With the core instruction cycle stable and ALU flags generating correctly (combinationally), the next critical step is implementing the **Flags Register** to properly latch and hold the C, Z, N status between instructions. This state-holding mechanism is essential for reliable conditional operations.

Once the Flags Register is implemented and controlled via microcode:
- Implement and test conditional jumps (`JZ`, `JC`).
- Implement and test a `CMP` instruction (Compare, affects flags like SUB).

Subsequent goals move toward a SAP-2-style architecture as described in Malvino's *Digital Computer Electronics*:
- Stack support via a dedicated stack pointer register.
- `CALL` and `RET` instructions for rudimentary subroutine support.
- Possibly expanding the RAM space or instruction width via parameterization.

These additions will allow the CPU to support more complex programs and branching logic.
